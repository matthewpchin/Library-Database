This Program has two sections: 1st- A user login system. 2nd- A library database system.

The user identification system allows you to create a username and password, change the password of an existing user, and use a saved 
users information to log into the library database. It is a basic system so all of the usernames and passwords are stored unencrypted 
within a MySQL database under table 'users'.

This Library data base is used to store the data of currently held content in a library by title, author, ISBN, and type.The library 
database system allows you to create an entry, search for multiple entries under multiple categories, and delete an entry based on
specific user entered information. All entries are stored in a MySQL database under table 'library_data'.

Future Potential Patches:
- An Encrypting function has not been added yet but is in the plans for the future.
